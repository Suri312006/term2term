have a way to "select" a conversation
that way you dont have to specify a user's thing
make users have private id's, that we use to identify them, but also have
public id's that others can use to identify them. 

how do we start a conversation?


con start?
- lists all users on the platform?


fuzzy find search for friends

start --list (lists people)
start --select (choose by name)

that way the cli can be stateless? not require human input.

create a state.toml somewhere
