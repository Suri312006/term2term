whats the plan?

#  lol
i want to learn more about rust the language, not the rattatui way of doing things
how do i do that?

- i feel that im kind of jumping tinto things way too quickly.
- i dont even have a way to have like multiple friends
- how am i even going to create friends even?
- what about proving identities?
- we also want people to be able to use the platform fully through the cli, soooooo


# okay so here is the plan rn
write up the basic schema to use this application with the uhhhhh cli, clap!
make sub commands, make other stuff and keep going
keep it simple, no tui, no async, no crypto
- goal is to have a robust system through the cli to message.
- eventually it would be cool to have like a daemon running that can get 
push notifications from the server.

after we have these done, then we can look into doing fancier stuff
use github issuse to track progress, i really like this behaviour

    - to make THE encrypted messaging platform, this is what industry does according to some 
    redditor
    - seems really fucking hard lmao holy moly
    - really good if i really want to deep dive into cryptogrophy later on
    



maybe we could have a t2t-gui and a normal t2t
